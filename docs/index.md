Knobbler is an iOS and Android app that communicates with a Max device that you add to your Live Set. It requires a compatible phone or tablet (iOS and Android) and a computer running Live 12 Suite or Standard (with Max for Live add-on), able to communicate directly with one another over a network.

Knobbler keeps you in the creative moment in your musicmaking by giving you fingertip access to the tracks, devices, and parameters in your Live Sets that matter the most.

It's an auto-labeling, auto-coloring, bidirectional control surface that you can customize for each song. Pick back up right where you left off with perfect recall, so you can work on several songs at once, each with their own ideal layout, saved inside the song file itself.

### Main Features

- Two pages of **16 assignable, auto-labeling, auto-coloring, high-resolution faders** that always show you exactly what is happening in your music.
- A page dedicated to **all of the parameters** of the currently selected device. Parameter banks are labeled, and just a touch away.
- Support for storing, recalling, and generating random **Variations** in Instrument, Audio Effect, and MIDI Racks.
- Eight **device shortcut buttons** to jump directly to the most important devices in your Live Set.
- An innovative **navigation system** that lets you dive through your tracks, groups, racks, chains, and devices faster than you can click a mouse.
- A **mixer channel strip** for the currently selected track, giving you control over volume, mute, solo, record, send levels, and even the crossfader.
- **Direct access** to familiar buttons from Live's toolbar, such as tap tempo, capture MIDI, and of course, transport controls.
- Support for **multiple tablets** with multiple Knobbler device instances.
