### Data Deletion Process

We use a third party service to track Knobbler signups and purchase history. This is for the purposes of optimizing the product experience and tracking the business side of the project.

No personal information is collected or shared with this service. No personally identifying information is tracked or stored in the service. The only information made available is an anonymized user ID, platform (Android or iOS), country code, app version, and timestamps around purchases and last visited.

If you would like your data records to be removed, please send a copy of the original purchase receipt to zack@steinkamp.us. We need the purchase ID and exact purchase time on the receipt because we do not collect name or email and there is no other way to look up the data record.

If you have any questions about this, please email zack@steinkamp.us.
