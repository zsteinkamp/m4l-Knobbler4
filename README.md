# Knobbler4

Knobbler4 turns your iPad (Android tablets soon) into an auto-labeling, auto-coloring, multitouch parameter control surface for Ableton Live. Add the Knobbler4 device to your Live Set and use your tablet to control devices and parameters.

Map parameters in your Ableton Live set to unmapped sliders on the tablet with a single touch. No need to enter and exit a mapping mode. Access every parameter in the currently selected device, directly on the tablet.

Parameter mapping configuration is saved with your Live Set, so you can switch between songs with minimal friction. Track, device, and parameter names are kept synchronized with your Live Set as you change them, even track colors!

Parameter sliders and values are updated in real time, with the same units (e.g. dB, ms, %) displayed as what you see in Live. Double tap a slider on the tablet to reset the parameter to its default value.

Quickly see and navigate around your tracks, groups, racks, chains, and devices with a touch.

Swipe out a channel strip to adjust the mixer settings of the currently selected track.
